These are things I want to remember in Go

## Format Strings

`%+v` is introduced by Dave Cheney's [errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) package. A common use case:

```go
if err != nil {
    // Add a stack
    err = errors.WithStack(err)
    log.Fatalf("%+v\n", err)
}
```

NOTE: I'm not sure this is the same as `panic(err)`. Something to check

`%#v` is equivalent to Python's `repr` function - it formats the data structure like it would look if you typed it in code.

```go
s = NewMyStruct(param1, param2)
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", s)
```
