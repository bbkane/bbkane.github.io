title: Software Engineering Ideas That Influence Me
---

I watch a lot of conference talks on YouTube and I read a lot of software engineering articles. Some of that media has really helped me become a better engineer. As a relatively young engineer, I know my style will develop further and my current judgment of "best practice" will change (and I can see how it's changed historically by looking at my old code), but I plan to read/watch these resources every year. I look forward to future me gaining new perspective on them.

- TODO: wrapping requests
- We shape our tools and our tools shape us. Don't make code so complicated it can only be navigated by IDE
- Write usage code first.
- TODO: find don't take math out of programming blog post
- TODO: embed YouTube videos and find out how to make width work on mobile devices
- TODO: add lessons to take away section. Maybe pontificate more on what's art and what's science
- Global variables are hard
