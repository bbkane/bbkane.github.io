NOTE (Sun Mar 10 - 2019-03-10 23:18:54 PDT) : I've moved this recipe to the Favorite Recipes post. I'll be removing this page after some time has passed.

This is a cheese ball recipe Grandma Howe gave to us on a recipe card that's delicious and not too hard to make. When I was younger, we kids would help Mom make this.

The brands are important on this recipe. Non Cracker Barrel cheese makes it taste different according to Mom (I've never tried any other brand)

Grandma wrote in all caps, but I'm mix-casing it here.

My added comments `look like this`.

Here's what's cookin': Cheese ball

Recipe from: Mom

`Grandma added dashes delineating the amounts and the units. The engineer in me
appreciates this :D (and I do love calling myself an engineer).`

- 1 - 8-oz. Shredded Cracker Barrel Sharp Cheese `This is the cheddar cheese`
- 1 - 8-oz. Philidelphia Cream Cheese
- 2 - tsp. chopped pimento
- 2 - tsp. chopped green pepper
- 2 - tsp. chopped onion
- 1 - tsp. Worchestershire sauce
- ½ tsp. lemon juice `no dashes here`

Combine cheese and softened cream cheese, mixing well.

Add remaining ingredients.

Chill until firm.

Roll into a ball and `cover with` chopped nuts or garnish with chopped parsley and pimento strips.
