When the office closed during the pandemic, my work stopped feeding me daily and I, like so many Bay Area tech workers, was forced to cook for myself.

We bedraggled individuals banded together on our company's #sadwfhmeals Slack channel to share our stories.

Recently, Stephanie Lucas made a video featured at the Button Conference 2020 -  (@buttonconf on Twitter) #Button2020 https://www.buttonconf.com/ . She posted it on [Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/90adcd1d13514e18a4a6e0fc754c4925), and I reposted it on my YouTube channel so I could embed it here.
