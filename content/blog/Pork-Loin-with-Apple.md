NOTE (Sun Mar 10 - 2019-03-10 23:18:54 PDT) : I've moved this recipe to the Favorite Recipes post. I'll be removing this page after some time has passed.

One day sometime last year (2017), I woke up and put the following into the
crock pot for my turn at cooking the family meal. I don't remember the exact
measurements, but it was delicious.

- Pork loin
- Garlic Cloves
- Onion Soup Mix
- Onions
- Apples
- Sauerkraut
- Cranberry Sauce (with cranberries)
