title: Listening to Videos on Android with the Screen Off
---

Android apps can make it surprisingly difficult to listen to videos. Often
times, I want to turn on a video, then just turn the screen off and listen to
it. Luckily, FireFox with some plugins will let me do that.

## Install

- Install the [FireFox app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en_US)
- Open the following links in your Firefox app and tap "+ Add to Firefox":
  - [Video Background Play Fix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-background-play-fix/) (I'm on version 1.2.1)
  - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) (I'm on version 1.17.4)

Now open a video site in FireFox, start the video, and tap that power button to
make your phone sleep. If it keeps playing, you did it!
