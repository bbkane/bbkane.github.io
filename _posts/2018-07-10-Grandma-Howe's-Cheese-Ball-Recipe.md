title: Grandma Howe's Cheese Ball Recipe
---

This is a cheese ball recipe Grandma Howe gave to us on a recipe card that's delicious and not too hard to make. When I was younger, we kids would help Mom make this.

The brands are important on this recipe. Non Cracker Barrel cheese makes it taste different according to Mom (I've never tried any other brand)

Grandma wrote in all caps, but I'm mix-casing it here.

My added comments `look like this`.
