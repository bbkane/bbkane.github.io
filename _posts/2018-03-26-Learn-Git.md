title: Learn Git
---

Git is a famously powerful and [famously confusing](https://xkcd.com/1597/) version control system
used by software engineers everywhere. Increasingly, as other types of work
begin to look more like software engineering (in my case network and systems
engineering), git becomes useful for those folks as well. In that regard, here
are some resources to learn git. I recommend you start at the top, get enough to
work with, play with git by yourself, and return for the more advanced stuff
when the basics don't cover your needs anymore.

- Atlassian covers some good ways to [install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git). I recommend the Homebrew method if you're on a Mac and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). It'll make it easy to install and update Git as well as other software.
- [Git Essentials
  LiveLessons](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/git-essentials-livelessons/9780134655284/)
  is a Safari Books Online video course for teaching the very beginnings of
  git. It's not a free resource, but it's a good one.
- The [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) is a short text
  introduction to using git.
- GitHub makes an [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
- [js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) has a very nice interactive tutorial on Git branches.

Once you have a decent workflow with git, you need to learn some of the theory
behind it and the more in-depth commands it offers:

- The [Git User Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual.html) is a
  relatively short introduction to some of git's features
- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a free online book for learning
  git that goes from beginner level to expert level. Very useful for learning
  the commands.
- [“Getting Git” by Scott Chacon](https://vimeo.com/14629850) is a great video
  explaining how git tracks content internally. A lot of git suddenly makes much
  more sense once you see it from the inside out.
- [Git For Ages 4 And Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4) is
  another really good video explaining git internals (though it's not perfect:
  questions interrupt the presenter, and it's cut short). As a bonus, I think
  everyone was required to dress like a hipster for it.

Git is such a flexible tool that there are multiple workflows possible for it.
Different teams will choose different workflows, but here are some of the more
popular ones:

- Atlassian makes a git tutorial centered around their product BitBucket - a
  pretty good git hosting center. It includes a [comparison of
  workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
- GitHub also highlights a workflow method [in one of their
  guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
