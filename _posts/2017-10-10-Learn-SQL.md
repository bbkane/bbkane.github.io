title: Learn SQL

SQL is one of the best benefit/cost skills to learn. It's fairly easy to learn,
and it immediately becomes useful for many jobs- including software
engineering, accounting, law, or any other job that deals with data.

## Learn SQL

I recommend the following links to learn SQL. To be completely honest, I
haven't tried all of them, but they look decent and they're free.

SQL (and other relational databases) are basically working with the math
concept of *sets*. It's much easier to learn SQL if you're somewhat familiar
with sets. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good resource for learning set
algebra, but if you just want a refresher, you can try the quizes at
[hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/databases/relational-algebra).
If you don't know anything about set algebra, don't get hung up on it- you'll
learn a lot of it through the following links.

For actually learning SQL, if you enjoy learning from videos, I recommend [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics).
If you'd rather readto learn, I recommend
[SQLCourse](http://www.sqlcourse.com/). Both of these sites include excersises
you can run without installing anything!

Once you want to practice SQL, head to

challenges!

## Work with SQL

### SQLite

Eventually you will want to create and play with your own databases. I
recommend starting with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [DB Browser for
SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/). These tools are both easy to install and
uninstall and each database you create is just a file so you can email it
between computers or copy it before trying something risky with your database.
In addition, SQLite might be the most used code in the world- every copy of
Windows 10 uses SQLite in the operating system, Firefox uses it to store
bookmarks, and every Android and IPhone has it. NASA is actually running SQLite
in space. Learning SQLite can be super valuable.

### MySQL (MariaDB)

Many web apps use MySQL (or its clone MariaDB). It's a tad more complicated to
set up than SQLite, but not too bad. I recommend installing
[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [MySQL
Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

Note that whichever SQL vendor (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, or whoever else) you
use will provide a somewhat different version of SQL, but for basic queries
they're pretty identical.
